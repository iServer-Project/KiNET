# KiNET
The lightweight multiplayer engine for iServer (Required for PocketTransfer)
## What does this do?
This is a simple and lightweight multiplayer engine, to open your server to more than the world, and prevent cheats / exploits.
## I'm making a iServer plugin, do I need this plugin for it to work?
Depends, if you're making a proxy or a base. Proxys (like PocketTransfer,) require it because there is no preset RakNet library. If you're making a base, you don't need it unless it calls to a KiNET function (@call KiNET*antiHack) and other.
